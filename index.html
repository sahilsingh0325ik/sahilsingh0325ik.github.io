  <h2> What is Basketball? </h2>
<body>
  <p> Basketball is a popular team sport where two teams of five players each compete on a rectangular court to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop, while preventing the opposing team from doing the same with the objective being to outscore the opposition.  </p>
  <h3> There are 3 main ways to score </h3>
  <p> 1. Free Throws </p>
  <p> 2. Field Goals </p>
  <p> 3. Three Pointers </p>
  <h2> The Facts</h2>
  <p> The game was created by James Naismith, a physical education teacher, on December 1, 1891 at what is now Springfield College.</p>

  <p> The creation of the game was met with great excitement and became a collegiate sport within a decade with the first professional league being established in 1898. </p>

  <p> Basketball became incorporated in the Olympic Games in 1936 and increasingly grew in popularity after World War 2. </p> 

  <p> The NBA (National Basketball Association) we now know today was formed in 1949 and cemented the sportâ€™s cultural importance in the United States, where it is found commonly being played at schools, parks, and at home. </p>

  <p> Basketball has also been globally embraced, most notably in Australia, China, Spain, and Italy, all of which have made significant contributions to the game. </p>
